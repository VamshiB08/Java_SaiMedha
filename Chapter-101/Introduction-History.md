# What is Java?

[![N|Solid](https://www.gcreddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Java-Programming-Language.png)](https://www.java.com/en/)

> Java is a popular programming language , developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

- It is used for: 
     - Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
    - Desktop applications
    - Web applications
    - Web servers and application servers
Games
    - Database connection
    - And much, much more!


## Why Use Java?

`Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)`
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
`It is open-source and free`
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
`Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs`
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa



## History
- At First Java was developed only for portable devices.
- It is a programming language created in 1991
- James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991.
- Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0
- `After the name OAK, the team decided to give a new name to it and the suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted the name to reflect the essence of technology`
- Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.

## Java Terminology

#### 1.  Java Virtual Machine(JVM):

- JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code. 
- JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
- `Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.`
- When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM. 


 [![N|Solid](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/jvm-3.jpg)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)

   - There are three execution phases of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.

        - Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.
        - The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
        - In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.
- `Java Virtual Machine is referred to as platform-dependent`



#### Bytecode
- The Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. 
- To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.
- `Byte Code can be defined as an intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language`.


####  Java Development Kit(JDK):

[![N|Solid](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201023214841/gfgjdk-660x423.jpg)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)

- It is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. 
- For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.
- JDK is also platform dependent.
- Present Version of JDK : 17
- When you install or setup JDK on local system, you will two commandline tools
-       javac - compiler
-       java - run-time tool

####   Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
- `The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software and provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.`
- JDK includes JRE. 
- JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. 
- JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.


####   Garbage Collector:
 - In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. 
 - To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage Collector. 
 - Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. 
 - However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.

####  ClassPath: 
 - The classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. 
 - By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath. 
 




#### Primary/Main Features of Java.
##### 1. Platform Independent:  
    - Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. 
    
    - This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. 
    
    - Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.
    
##### 2. Object-Oriented Programming Language
    
> Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.
    The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

##### 3. Simple:  
Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation. 

##### 4. Robust:
- Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. 
- The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.


##### 5.Secure:
- In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so. 
-  That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. 
- Also java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure .


##### 6.Distributed:
- We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. 
- The java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.

##### 7. Multithreading:  
> Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU.


##### 8. Portable:  
>As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable. 

##### 9. Write Once Run Anywhere: 
>As discussed above java application generates a ‘.class’ file which corresponds to our applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides ease  architecture-neutral ease as bytecode is not dependent on any machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.

#### 10.Power of compilation and interpretation: 
- Most languages are designed with purpose either they are compiled language or they are interpreted language. 
- But java integrates arising enormous power as Java compiler compiles the source code to bytecode and JVM  executes this bytecode to machine OS-dependent executable code.


#### First Program

```java
// Importing classes from packages
import java.io.*;

// Main class
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) // Main driver method
	{
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java World"); // Print statement
	}
}
```
##### Comments 
- // Single line comment
- /* Multi line comments*/

`import java.io.*`: This means all the classes of io package can be imported. Java io package provides a set of input and output streams for reading and writing data to files or other input or output sources.

 `class`: The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program. Methods define the behavior of the class. Class GFG has only one method Main in JAVA.
 
 `static void main()`: static keyword tells us that this method is accessible without instantiating the class. 
  
`void`: keywords tell that this method will not return anything. The main() method is the entry point of our application.

 `System.in`: This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.
 
  `System.out`: This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.
  
  `println()`: This method in Java is also used to display text on the console. It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing takes place from the next line.
  
   `String []args`: This is the argument passed to the main function which is an array of strings with the array name args. One can choose their own flexible name but this name is used by many developers
   
   `Everything in java , is represented in Class as an object including the main function.`
